# KIERA
Source Code of Knowledge Retention in Self-Adaptive Deep Continual Learner (KIERA) presented in the paper titled "Unsupervised Continual Learning via Self-Adaptive Deep Clustering Approach" published in International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence Workshop on Continual Semi-Supervised Learning (CSSL@IJCAI) (https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14563).

To run KIERA for all datasets used in the paper, one can go to run_continualLearning-Kiera.IPYNB.
To run individually for a specific dataset, one can go to ADCN-%dataset name%. IPYNB.

For our raw numerical results as presented in the paper, one can check it in run_continuallearning-Kiera.html
